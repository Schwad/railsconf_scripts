# RailsConf Scripts

## Executable Scripts

In this repo there are Active Record executable scripts and a couple Ruby scripts
for my lab at RailsConf 2015 on Contributing to Rails.

RailsConf talk description:

> **Breaking Down the Barrier: Demystifying Contributing to Rails**

> Contributing to Rails for the first time can be terrifying. In this lab I’ll
make contributing to Rails more approachable by going over the contributing
guidelines and technical details you need to know. We’ll walk through traversing
the source code with tools such as CTags, source_location and TracePoint.
Additionally, we’ll create reproduction scripts for reporting issues and learn
advanced git commands like bisect and squash. At the end of this session you’ll
have the confidence to fix bugs and add features to Ruby on Rails.

### Running the scripts

Clone or move these scripts into your Rails directory because we will be running
these inside the Rails repo.

To run:

```
cd /your/local/rails/copy
bundle exec ruby railsconf_scripts/ar_script_name.rb
```

If you don't have Rails source repo, just clone these anywhere on your filesystem.

## Practicing Git

Checkout the `practicing-git` branch.

The `practicing-git` branch is a branch for practicing git commands for my RailsConf
lab on contributing to Rails. Please see that branch for git the git commands.
